WMOL is a small molecule visualisation program which uses JavaScript canvas library to display a 3D molecular plot for SHELX, CIF, XYZ, and PDB files. The progam could be used as a JavaScript library or integrated into a Python project. The program is based on ch5m3d.js.

There are two ways to use this program. The first one is to open index_main.html file in an internet browser and then use "browse" button to open a molecular file. 

Alternatively the program could be accesed through a python script included in the project. 
To test the program using python simply run the command below in the project directory:


python wmol.py ./test/test.res
